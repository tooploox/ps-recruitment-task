### Android Developer - Recruitment Task

### Song App

You are to develop an application that is designed to fetch list of songs from local
and remote data sources. Display the data in a way that is readable to the user.

### The app 

Your app is supposed to fetch and display data from two sources. 
One of them is remote
(https://affiliate.itunes.apple.com/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api/#searchexamples), the other should be a local JSON file embedded in the app. Feel free to use the file stored in this repository.

As a user, you should be able to: 

1. Choose the source of data: remote, local or both.
2. See the list of all songs with their artist and release year. 


### Expectations
- The result should be a native application written in Kotlin.
- We know you have a life outside of interviewing with Tooploox, so there is no external due date to perform this task. However we do expect you to set that date, communicate it with us and deliver within the timeline.
- You should pay attention to the architecture of the app and usage of design patterns and data structures. 
- Due to the current situation remote work is becoming increasingly prevalent and being accountable for your work is important. We want to be able to track you progress via Git. We appreciate incremental commits and a consistent branching strategy. Simply send us a link to the remote repository.
- You should write example unit tests to show that your solution is testable (at least 1 test per architecture layer).
- You should write the app in a way that could be easily extended. Think of it this way: the app will be actively developed by a team of 5 over the course of next year.


### Tips

- We value architecture over features so don’t bother adding pagination or search feature (a hardcoded query is enough).
- Code should be easily extended with new features without major changes throughout the codebase (e.g. think about adding a new source).
- App code should be idiomatic - we love Kotlin and we want to see that you do too.
- App code should be tested or at least testable.
- We like to see that Gradle is used deliberately.
- It’s easier to read the code when it’s well formatted and the code style is consistent.
- The app should follow best practices in code. Lint can help you with that.
- There shouldn’t be any obvious errors or crashes.
